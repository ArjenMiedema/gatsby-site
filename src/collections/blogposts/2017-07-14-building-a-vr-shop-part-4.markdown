### Building a VR shop - Part 4: Use the VR module in your Magento shop
We have arrived at the last part in the VR blogseries. In this part, we will take a look at implementing the VR module in your Magento shop. This is rather a short blogpost, since the extension is pretty straightforward and simple to use.

#### Blog parts
* Part 1: [Bringing VR to the Web](/blog/building-a-vr-shop-part-1/)
* Part 2: [Building an interactive VR World](/blog/building-a-vr-shop-part-2/)
* Part 3: [Bringing products into the VR world](/blog/building-a-vr-shop-part-3/)
* Part 4: [Use the VR module in your Magento shop](/blog/building-a-vr-shop-part-4/)

#### GitHub Repository
We have decided to publish the VR project on GitHub. You can visit the GitHub repository [right here](https://github.com/elgentos/Magento-VR). On this page, you will also find instructions on how to use the extension in your own webshop.

The project consists out of two parts: the VR application and the Magento module. You simply install the Magento extension in your webshop. The VR application can be located anywhere else and can be configured by editing the config.js file.

#### Future
Virtual Reality is still in its infancy, so it might take a couple of years for the technique to become mainstream. We really think VR has a lot of potential and we can't wait to see where it will be in a few years. We'll keep an eye on it!
